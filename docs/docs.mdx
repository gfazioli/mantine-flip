import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-flip" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-flip/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-flip` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-flip/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-flip/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

## Uncontrolled

<Demo data={demos.uncontrolled} />

## Controlled

You may control the state of the card by setting the `flipped` prop to `true` or `false`.
This is useful when you want to control the state of the card from the parent component.

<Demo data={demos.controlled} />

> **Initial face and Flip.Target**
>
> For controlled Flip components, you will use `useState` to determine which side of the component to initially show.
> Additionally, you will not need to use `Flip.Target` for buttons, but you can control them manually to keep the states synchronized.

## Default Flipped (face)

You may display the initial face of the card by setting the `defaultFlipped` prop to `true`.

<Demo data={demos.defaultFlipped} />

## Styled Flip component

You can style the `Flip` component using the `classNames` prop to target specific inner elements. This allows for granular customization of the component's appearance.

<Demo data={demos.styled} />

## Styles API

`Flip` supports [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/), you can add styles to any inner element of the component with `classNames` prop. Follow [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/) documentation to learn more.

You can customize the appearance of the `Flip` component using the Styles API. This allows you to modify styles for various parts of the component, such as keys, values, brackets, and more.

## Example: Credit card

<Demo data={demos.creditCard} />

## Example: Signin form

Click on "Create account" to flip the card.

<Demo data={demos.signin} />

## Example: Grid Widget

Given that the Flip component behaves like a MacOS Widget, it is important to understand where and how to set the dimensions to avoid overflow issues.
