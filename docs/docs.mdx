## Controllded

You may control the state of the card by setting the `flipped` prop to `true` or `false`.
This is useful when you want to control the state of the card from the parent component.

<Demo data={demos.controlled} />

> **Inital face and Flip.Target**
>
> For controlled Flip components, you will use `useState` to determine which side of the component to initially show.
> Additionally, you will not need to use `Flip.Target` for buttons, but you can control them manually to keep the states synchronized.


## Default Flipped (face)

You may display the initial face of the card by setting the `defaultFlipped` prop to `true`.

<Demo data={demos.defaultFlipped} />
