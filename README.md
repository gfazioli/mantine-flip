## Overview

This component is created on top of the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library.

[Mantine Flip](https://gfazioli.github.io/mantine-flip/) is a two-face container that animates between a front and a back view, ideal for compact UIs that need progressive disclosure (e.g., editing panels, settings, sign-in/sign-up toggles, or profile details). It supports both uncontrolled usage with Flip.Target to wire any element as a click trigger, and controlled usage via flipped/defaultFlipped using React state for full synchronization with your app logic. The component enforces exactly two children, accepts size constraints (w/h), and offers transition customization such as vertical flipping and distinct rotation directions for flip-in and flip-out. Styling hooks (classNames/Styles API) let you target inner parts for design refinement, while examples demonstrate practical patterns like credit-card editing, modal-like settings panes, and multi-target triggers within a single face.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @gfazioli/mantine-flip
```
or 

```sh
yarn add @gfazioli/mantine-flip
```

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-flip/styles.css';
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Flip } from '@gfazioli/mantine-flip';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Flip h={200} w={200}>

        <Paper radius="md" withBorder p="lg" shadow="md">
          <h3>Front Card</h3>
          <Flip.Target>
            <Button>Flip Back</Button>
          </Flip.Target>
        </Paper>

        <Paper radius="md" withBorder p="lg" shadow="md">
          <h3>Back Card</h3>
          <Flip.Target>
            <Button>Flip Front</Button>
          </Flip.Target>
        </Paper>

    </Flip>
  );
}
```

As you can see, the `Flip` component wraps two children, which are the two views that you want to flip between.
The `Flip.Target` component is used to define the trigger for the flip animation. It can be any component, such as a button, or a link, or even a div.
